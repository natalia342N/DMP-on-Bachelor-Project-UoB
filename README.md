Output Data research in Hydraulic Processes

Introduction
This is a data set that contains analysis and modelling that will help to
understand local coastal processes and its change over the years at Medmerry
Managed Realignment study site. The first set of analysis investigated the data with
splitting it into 3 months period for the period of data collection at Medmerry. Those
will be compared and analyze against tidal data used from location at Lymington which is in suffiecient distance from study site.

Note that tidal data is appropriately adjusted to Chart Datum below displayed on the
graph. 

Installation

In order to access and analyse the data no further packages other than standard Office package is required. 

Methodology

In order to perform this research, we will take two datasets Medmerry and Lymington datasets, from which we will build a new data sets Analysis Tidal range and Storms vs Depth datasets. Additionally, we will use data set that contains Lunar cycles data to help us understand specific processess in the studied location.
